:wave: Hello there, welcome to my site. I use this Github page to host my personal website and to practice front end code. I first start on this [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/xMU6oOonRxksm89trPsaD5/levogirar.com?t=P3agGeLfCrW9Wq8K-1) and then I try to code it in Visual Studio Code. 

My career journey has always been focused on the intersection of business and technology. I have a passion for building products that solve real problems and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow.

I currently work at <a href="https://www.shopify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a> as a Senior Support Specialist on the Key Accounts team. I help our largest merchants with their technical needs and help them grow their business.
